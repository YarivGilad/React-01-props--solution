### It's time for a Vacation!!
-------------------------------->

1. Create a `<Vacation>` component that has a boolean prop named **`available`**
2. The component should render an \<h1>    
   with either the text *"Going on vacation"* or *"Too busy for Vacations"*
   depending on the prop value being it true or false.
3. create an instance of the <Vacation> component in the main <App> component.

```
